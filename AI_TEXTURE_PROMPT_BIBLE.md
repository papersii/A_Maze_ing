# AI Art Direction & Meta-Prompt Bible
# AI 美术指导与元提示词圣经

> **Role**: World-Class Game Art Director (世界级游戏美术总监)
> **Goal**: Create unified, premium, high-readability assets for a top-down 2D game.
> **Style Target**: "Stylized Hand-Painted Fantasy" (风格化手绘奇幻) - precise, vibrant, and timeless.

## 1. The "Meta-Prompt" Core Logic (元提示词核心逻辑)

To ensure consistency, every prompt must be constructed using this **Modular Formula (模块化公式)**:

```text
[Subject Definition] + [Viewpoint & Layout] + [Composition & Padding] + [Art Style Pillars] + [Material & Lighting] + [Technical Enforcers] + [--no Negative Prompts]
```

### 1.1 Art Style Pillars (美术风格支柱 - Must Include in Every Prompt)
Use these keywords to lock the visual identity:
> **"Game Asset, Sprite Sheet Style, Hand-painted texture, Stylized Realism, Vibrant Color Palette, Clean Vector-like Lines, Thick Brushstrokes, Digital 2D Painting, High Fidelity, Blizzard/Riot Art Style, Defined Silhouette."**

### 1.2 Viewpoint & Layout (视角与布局)
- **General**: "Top-down Orthographic 90 degree view" (strictly flat for 2D grid games).
- **Walls**: "Top-down 3/4 perspective, showing top face and front face, modular design."
- **Floors**: "Direct top-down flat view, seamless texture pattern."

### 1.3 Composition & Padding (构图与留白 - CRITICAL)
**Prevent "Cut-off" is the #1 priority.**
- **Keywords**: "Isolated on White Background, Centered, Wide shot, Surrounded by empty space, Entire object visible, No cropping."
- **Logic**: Use a wider field of view (e.g. "Zoomed out view") to ensure the edges of the wall/prop never touch the canvas border.

## 2. Category-Specific Master Prompts (分类大师级提示词)

### 🧱 Type A: Walls & Obstacles (墙体与障碍)
**Design Goal**: Solid, heavy looking, clearly defined "Top" (walkable visual) and "Front" (blocking visual).
**Meta-Prompt Template**:
```
[Material] Wall Element for Top-Down RPG Game, Orthographic Projection. 
Single modular block, clearly defined Top Face (lighter) and Front Face (darker, shadowed). 
Style: Hand-painted stylized texture, chunky stone/wood/metal details, ambient occlusion in crevices. 
Composition: Isolated on Solid White Background, Centered, 20% transparent padding around object.
Sharp edges, no cast shadow on ground, game ready asset, fully visible.
```
**Example (Dungeon Wall)**:
> "Ancient Grey Stone Wall block, heavy granite texture with moss details. Top-down RPG game asset. Hand-painted stylized style, thick outlines. Clearly defined top surface and vertical front face. High contrast between top and side. Solid White Background. --no perspective slant, 3d render, photorealism"

### 🟦 Type B: Floor Tiles (地面贴图)
**Design Goal**: Low noise, high seamlessness, does not distract from player/enemies.
**Meta-Prompt Template**:
```
Seamless Tiling Texture of [Material], [Theme] Surface. flat top-down view.
Pattern: Repetitive but natural, avoiding obvious grid lines.
Style: Hand-painted blizzard style, soft diffuse lighting, low contrast details (to let charas pop).
Color Palette: [Theme Colors].
Full frame texture, no borders.
```
**Example (Lava Floor)**:
> "Seamless Molten Magma floor texture, crusted cooling black rock with glowing orange cracks. Hand-painted game texture. Flat top-down view. Low contrast, soft glow. High fidelity. --no artifacts, blurry, grid lines, watermarks"

### ⚔️ Type C: Props & Items (道具与物品)
**Design Goal**: Instantly readable silhouette, "Pop" functionality.
**Meta-Prompt Template**:
```
Single Game Sprite of [Item Name], [Theme] style. 
View: Top-down orthographic 45-degree angle (to show volume).
Style: Vibrant colors, magical glow (if applicable), thick bold outline, stylized digital painting.
Composition: On Solid White Background, Centered, Wide margin, Entire object within frame.
```
**Example (Treasure Chest)**:
> "Golden Royal Treasure Chest with jewels, closed. Top-down game sprite. Hand-painted stylized art. Shiny gold metal, rich wood texture. Magical aura. Solid White Background. --no cut off, multiple items, complex background"

### ✨ Type D: VFX & Particles (特效与粒子)
**Design Goal**: Dynamic, fluid, additive blending ready.
**Meta-Prompt Template**:
```
Game Visual Effect Sprite, [Effect Name], [Element] type.
Style: Cell-shaded anime FX, clean shapes, fluid motion blur stylistic.
On Solid Black Background (for screen blend) OR Solid Transparent Background.
High luminosity, saturation.
```
**Example (Explosion)**:
> "2D Cartoon Explosion effect, single frame keyart. Fire and Smoke clouds. Anime style blast. Vibrant Orange and Grey. Solid Black Background. --no dithering, noise"

## 3. The "Secret Sauce" Parameters (独家参数调优)

When using Midjourney/DALL-E/Stable Diffusion, apply these modifier weights:

- **Stylize**: High (e.g., `--s 250` in MJ) to push the "Artistic" feel over "Realism".
- **Quality**: Max.
- **Negative Prompts (Use these to filter garbage)**:
  > **--no** cropped, cut off, out of frame, partial, touching edges, close up, macro shot, 3d render, blender, photorealistic, noise, dusty, dirty, grainy, low res, jpeg artifacts, watermark, text, signature, perspective distortion, vanishing point, isometric grid lines, blurry edges.

## 4. Workflow for Consistency (一致性工作流)

1.  **Seed Locking**: If you generate a perfect "Grass Floor", keep its Seed/Style Reference ID. Use it to generate the "Grass Wall" to ensure color matching.
2.  **Palette Control**: Always append "Color Palette: [Hex Codes or Descriptive names]" if the AI drifts. e.g., "Color Palette: Emerald Green, Dark Slate Grey".
3.  **Downscaling Logic**: Generate at 1024x1024 or 512x512. Downscale to 64x64 using "Nearest Neighbor" (if pixel perfect) or "Bicubic Sharper" (if hand-painted) then apply a slight "Unsharp Mask" to pop details at low res.

## 5. Theme Specific Keywords (主题关键词库)

- **Grassland**: "Lush green, soft blades, small flowers, sunlit, gentle earth tones."
- **Desert**: "Scorched sand, sandstone, dry cracks, warm orange and yellow, sun-bleached bone."
- **Ice**: "Glacial blue, frost overlay, crystalline, hard edges, cold white and cyan, reflective."
- **Jungle**: "Deep overgrown green, vines, mossy ruins, humidity, tropical, dark shadows."
- **Space**: "Metallic panels, sci-fi vents, neon lights, dark chrome, industrial grey, blueprint blue."
